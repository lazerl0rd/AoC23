# Advent of Code [20]23 is here!

I've structured this repository as follows:

- AoC23
	- day1
		- input.\<File Extension\>
		- requirements.md
		- run.sh
		- solution.\<File Extension\>
	- day2
		- input
			- ...
		- requirements.md
		- run.sh
		- solution
			- ...
	- ...


Every day has a folder assigned to it. If the solution is a single file, it is stored as `solution.\<File Extension\>`. If, however, the solution contains multiple files and or directories, it is stored within a `solution` sub-folder. The same applies to input files. A script called `run.sh` exists in each day folder to run the program. A Markdown file called `requirements.md` exists in each day folder containing a list of required programs to run the solution.
